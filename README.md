# Features

* Borrowers can create their loan proposal with the amount they want, their favourable repayment due date and CID of their mortgage uploaded on IPFS.
> As of now we are using a decentralised public IPFS gateway. To use our DApp generate your file CID [here](https://www.dreamlink.cloud/) before adding it as a mortgage.
* Lender's can verify the borrower's data and send their proposal with their favourable interest rate.
* Borrower's can choose multiple lenders of their interest.
* Borrower can repay the loan anytime they want before the due date and amortized loan will be transacted.
* After the repayment date has passed, borrower cannot repay the loan and their mortgage will be revoked and auctioned off.
